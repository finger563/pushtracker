# PushTracker

This device is designed to detect pushes on a manual wheelchair by
using an accelerometer.  It provides user interaction and feedback
through a rotary+push switch and a 128x128 pixel color OLED.

It was designed and developed in 2010-2011 for research into the activity level of manual wheelchair users and was entered into the 2011 RESNA Student Design Competition, where it won the highest award and was presented at RESNA 2011 in Toronto, CA.
